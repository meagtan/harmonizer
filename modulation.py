## Recognizing modulation using EM
# The goal is to separate a piece of music into k regions such that each region is in a different key.
# P(r|(n_t)) ~ P(r) P(t|r) sum(P(k|r) P(n_t|t, k), k) â‰ˆ P(r) P(t|r) P(n_t|t, k_max)
# P(t|r) is approximated as a normal distribution with variable mean but common variance.
# The region boundaries are controlled by the region means and weights, which provides cleaner and wider decision boundaries.
# The most likely key within a region is optimized by looking at the histogram of the region.
